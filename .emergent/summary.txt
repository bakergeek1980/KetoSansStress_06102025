The AI engineer's trajectory on KetoSansStress demonstrates a robust iterative development process, addressing user requests and critical bugs. Initially, the focus was on resolving a backend import error in  and then a frontend  API change and  rendering issue, transitioning to placeholders for charts. A major feature involved configuring a comprehensive meal entry system with camera, gallery, and manual input, alongside a functional food search and barcode scanning for all meal types, backed by new backend APIs. The application's UI was refined by removing a redundant bottom navigation bar. Subsequently, a complete and responsive user registration page with detailed fields and strong frontend/backend validation was implemented, culminating in a full email confirmation system including new frontend pages and backend endpoints. The most recent work initiated the user profile management system, making the dashboard logo clickable to reveal a , and starting the Mot de Passe Oublié flow. The engineer consistently debugged issues, often identified by the user, and re-tested, ensuring a stable and feature-rich application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the user's explicit request for a comprehensive **user profile management system**. This involved making the green circular logo on the main dashboard clickable to open a modal containing all user settings and actions.

The work completed in this immediate phase includes:
1.  ** Creation**: A new file, , was created. This modal is designed to house editable user profile parameters, password change, logout, and account deletion features. Currently, it serves as a structural placeholder.
2.  **Dashboard Header Modification**: The main dashboard screen, , was modified to include a custom header. This header now prominently features the KetoSansStress green circular logo.
3.  **Clickable Logo Integration**: The green logo in the dashboard header has been made interactive using a . Tapping this logo now triggers the  function, which controls the visibility of the .
4.  ** JSX Integration**: The  component has been integrated into the JSX of , ensuring it renders conditionally based on the  state.
5.  **Styling Updates**: New styles (e.g., , , ) have been added to  to properly display and position the clickable logo, replacing older profile button styles.
6.  **Mot de Passe Oublié Page Initiation**: The AI engineer has just begun the task of creating the dedicated page for the Mot de Passe Oublié (Forgot Password) flow, which is part of the broader user profile management requirements. This work is in its very early stages.

The application currently displays the clickable logo on the dashboard, which successfully opens the (currently unpopulated) . The next steps involve populating this modal with functionality and completing the password reset flow.
